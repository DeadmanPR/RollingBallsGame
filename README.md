# Brief Explanation of the Game:
First thing you need to do is find a buddy to play with, and both need to create a profile in order to play.

Before the game starts, you need to decide the number of balls that each player will have. After selecting the number of balls, you will be presented with the game screen.

The objective of the game is simple: Get all your opponents' balls while still having your own.

*But it's not that easy!*


Each player has a quantity called *distance*. This *distance* represents the accumulated distance that you can move your balls.

Player 1 will start the game. In order to make your move, you need to select your ball by clicking on it (by the way, choose wisely, as you can't change your ball once you selected one). After that, you will be prompted to enter the angle and distance that you want the ball to move. When you think you're done, click the "Shoot!" button.

As your ball moves, be careful with what it collides, because it can have a nice effect, or pretty bad one!

The black balls are *Obstacles*. They won't serve any purpose other than rebounding your ball when it hits.

The red balls are *Mines*. Be careful with these, as they will explode on contact, taking out with it the ball that hit it, and any objects close to it! You will lose 50 points (distance) if you hit one of these.

The *Happy Faces* act like Obstacles, but have a nice bonus: You gain 50 points (distance)! Isn't that nice?

If you hit an opponent's ball,  you gain 100 points (distance) and your opponent loses 100 points!

The game ends when one of these happen:
- A player's distance reaches 0.
- A player runs out of balls.

Go ahead and have some fun!
